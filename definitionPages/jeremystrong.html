        Jeremy Strong possesses an unshakable dedication to his craft that I deeply admire. He is a true artist, which is increasingly rare to come by. The following list transcribes the books he talks about loving in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYCAT5jpXKU" target="_blank">GQ 10 things</a> interview. <br>
        <br>
        <em>Diaries 1898 - 1902</em>, Alma Mahler Werfel: Married to Klimt and Mahler. Discusses the dichotomy between the loving soul and the calculating soul. Her belief was that these great creators made work of real value when they were operating from the loving soul. <br>
        <em>Spectator Bird</em>, Wallace Stegner: Discusses the pain in every choice. To be young and have infinite possibilities before growing up and having to collapse choices, thus losing that infinite possibility.  <br>
        <em>Owning Your Own Shadow</em>, Robert A. Johnson: Jungian dreamwork. Understanding the shadow self.
        <em>The Caretaker</em>, Harold Pinter: His favorite play. <br>
        <em>The Actor and The Target</em>, Declan Donnellan: His favorite book on acting. <br>
        <em>Wherever You Go There You Are</em>, John Kabat-Zinn: A book on mindfulness. (I’ve watched lectures from Kabat-Zinn and they’re incredible.) <br>
        <em>Four Quartets</em>, T.S. Elliot: When Strong was enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the principal told them all to get this book, he said it was the only thing they needed to know about acting. He highlights the line “Quick now, here, now, always—A condition of complete simplicity(Costing not less than everything)And all shall be well.” <br>
        <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, Proust: Read in his early 20s, contain much of what anyone could hope to learn about life. (Modernist masterpiece.) <br>
       <em>My Struggle</em>, Knausgaard: Strong’s favorite. He calls it the most honest expression of life that he’s ever read anywhere. “The accumulation of granular moments makes you realize there are no small moments.” <br>
