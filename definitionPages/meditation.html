    I try to meditate for 10 minutes every morning but I often forget to. I have this app called insight timer that plays a bell to start and end your meditations and offers guided meditations and keeps track of how many days in a row you’ve timed yourself. I’m very inconsistent but right now I’m on a four day streak, which I feel good about. <br>

Some days, I’ve noticed, it’s a lot easier for me to let the peace and beauty of the morning fill my mind. Some days my mind is racing from the moment I wake up. On these days, instead of letting my thoughts push me outside of my own body and drag me through the street, meditation helps me notice them like
