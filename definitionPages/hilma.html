        My favorite artist is Swedish abstract painter Hilma af Klint. Klint had a very deep spiritual practice that inspired her work. Instead of summarizing, I highly recommend you read 
        <a href="https://bulletin.hds.harvard.edu/paths-to-abstraction-spirituality-in-the-work-of-three-women-artists/" target="_blank">this essay,</a>
        which discusses her practice in detail, and 
        <a href="https://hilmaafklint.se/about-hilma-af-klint/" target="_blank">this page,</a>
        which summaries her timeline as an artist. <br>
        Klint's magnum opus "The Ten Largest" was created as apart of her "great commission," a period in which Klint served as a conduit for the spirit and created 193 paintings in its guidance. <br>
        The Ten Largest display human life from birth to death. The first two of the series depict birth, the next two depict adolecence, this is followed by four depicting adulthood, and two that show old age into 
        <a href="death.html">death.</a> <br>
        Klint's work contains 
        <a href="spiral.html">messages</a>
        that we have not found the words to articulate. She is a master of 
        <a href="symbols.html">symbolism.</a>
        If I was extremely wealthy, I would buy several of her works so I could spend extended time 
        <a href="meditation.html">meditating</a>
        upon them. I want nothing more than to create something so transcedent and true. <br>
