        It is said that cleanliness is next to godliness. Being able to tidy ourselves and space is what keeps us above animals. Because it is in our nature to be messy and wild and itch our armpits like monkeys, to keep clean requires constant upkeep. Constant laundry and dishes and showers and pruning our nails and skin and wiping down surfaces and sweeping floors and throwing things away. Sometimes the chores are annoying but if you accept them they can be very relaxing. Getting clean is a great way to display care for yourself and those around you. <br>
        But my favorite form of cleanliness is not human. It is found in natureâ€™s precision and smoothness. A rock that has been weathered smooth. The crisp fold at the peak of a wind-blown sand dune. A bubble. A ripple. The prismatic cleavage of a crystal. Untouched snow. Fresh air. <br>

        slowly and deeply. I do not move. My mind does

        wander. I pray for forgiveness. I am clean. <br>
