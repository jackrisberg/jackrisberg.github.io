<span> Like attention, energy is one of our most valuable personal resources. Energy is what everything and one needs to run, and the more energy you have, the more you can do. There are many ways you can get your energy stock up, such as by getting enough sleep at night, eating at least two meals each day, and exercising. <br>
    If you are wanting to investigate and improve your life, I suggest you start with mapping out where your energy is coming from and where it is going. Then, try to increase your energy intake before you try to adjust the direction of your output. <br>
    Become aware of how different recreational drugs (caffeine, nicotine, THC, alcohol) cause your energy to fluctuate, both during and after using them. Take note of the central figures in your life, and ask yourself how they might affect your energy levels. Ask yourself if you are pouring energy into anything you don’t love or believe in. If yes, ask yourself why. Ask yourself if there is a better way. Do not make excuses. <br>
    The energy you receive is not yours to keep, it is moving through you. You are a conduit. Try to be a good one. If you let received energy slowly leak out of your ears, paying little attention to where and how you’re moving it, you may find energy hard to come by. On the other hand, if you move received energy with powerful and pure intention, you are proving to be an excellent conduit and will find energy boundless. My friend Kisara is great at this.  </span>
