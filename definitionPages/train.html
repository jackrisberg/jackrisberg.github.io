        <span>The train is the superior mode of transportation. It is 
        <a href="beautyandsublime.html">sublime.</a>
        Sublime means it is awe-inspiring while also invoking terror. Every time the train pulls up to the platform, I think about it killing me. When I’m not thinking about the train 
        <a href=death.html> killing me,</a> 
        I think about how it is a quick and sustainable mode of travel. I think about how it is a great place to witness others, those moving alongside you, through and within this space, from point A to B.
