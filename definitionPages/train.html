        <span>The train is the superior mode of transportation. It is sublime. Sublime means it is awe-inspiring while also invoking terror. Every time the train pulls up to the platform, I think about it killing me. When Iâ€™m not thinking about the train killing me, I think about how it is a quick and sustainable mode of travel. I think about how it is a great place to witness others, those moving alongside you, through and within this liminal space, from point A to B. </span>
