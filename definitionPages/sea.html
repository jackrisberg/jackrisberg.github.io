      Sea/Ocean (force):
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
<span>Though the word sea technically refers to a specific region of water, and there are four distinct oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, and Indian), I use these terms interchangeably to describe the water that surrounds the masses of earth land. The word sea captures a certain romance that the word ocean cannot. And the word ocean captures the vastness of this force better than the word sea can. The ocean, as weâ€™ll call it for today, is the heart of the earth. Its waves crash on to the shore as a heartbeat, never ending. </span>
