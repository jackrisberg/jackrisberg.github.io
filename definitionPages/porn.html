        Porn (infection): 
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        Watching porn is like shooting up with a dirty needle. It poisons the mind into believing that falsified images are desirable. In the infection’s final, most terrible form, the mind prefers the falsified images to a real human body. It compromises the user’s ability to engage in real sex, as the mind no longer understands what eroticism is. <br>
        I am terrified by effects of pornography on society at large. So many people consistently consume images of these exaggerated power dynamics, images that conflate violence and aggression with eroticism, and we hardly talk about it! And then, on the rare occasion it is brought up, it’s by someone who doesn’t recognize the nuances of the problem. <br>
        From my own experiences, I think the basic narratives of pornography are true to what people desire. I want to surrender, yield, give. I don’t want to be asked permission. I don’t want to think about right and wrong. But to have this freedom during sex comes from building trust with another person, not from projecting a fantasy on to their body. <br>
