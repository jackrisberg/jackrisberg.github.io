        I cannot explain the euphoria of being home on a Friday night, getting ready to go out with my roommates. <br>
        Girls playing dress up, girls putting on makeup, girls dancing and singing to a queue of their favorite party songs. Someone has decided to make cocktails and they are very strong. You can’t find your perfume but here, try this one or this one or this one. You look amazinggggg. Can you help me with the back of my hair? Can you help me with this clasp? Can I hit your vape? Do you think jacket or no jacket? No jacket. Is my eyeliner even? Yes, very. We’re leaving in 2 minutes. My phone is literally at 8%. Just don’t use it. These shoes are uncomfortable. You should wear a pair that won’t make you miserable. They’re not that bad. Should we each take a shot? Ewwww. It’s the economic choice. That’s too big! Okokokok. Cheers. Uggghhhh. Gross. Phone, wallet, keys, lipstick, lighter. Phone, wallet, keys, lipgloss, juul. The Uber is out front! Do you have everything? Yes, do you? I think so. Okay, yayyyyyy! This will be fun! You’ve been here before? Yeah I went back in August with— SLAM, locked, handle checked. <br>
        It’s just so funnnnn! It’s so much fun! It’s the most fun a girl can have! And then, after hours of dancing and sweating and talking to random girls in the bathroom, you come back home to the mess you made and eat Taco Bell and talk about it all. Someone wants to smoke weed. Someone needs to shower IMMEDIATELY. Someone got a boys number. Someone else thought he was being creepy. Someone is so tired. We go to bed. We do it again and again and again.
