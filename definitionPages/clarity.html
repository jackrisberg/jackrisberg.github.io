    <div class="definition">
     To exist in clarity is not easy. It means… <br>
        —sacrificing the euphoric haze of juggling uppers and downers <br>
        —sitting in the discomfort of boredom, and occasionally painful 
        <a href="weather.html">emotion</a> <br>
        —not closing your eyes to the ugly things <br>
        —making time to revel in the 
        <a href="present.html">present,</a>
        to say “this is a day of my life.” <br>
        —recognizing and minimizing distraction <br>
