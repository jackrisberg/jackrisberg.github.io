        Digital (adjective, state): 
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
     The word digital comes from the word digit, which is a name for your fingers, and also a name for a single number, such as zero or one, from which all of the online world is formed. Thus, digital is another word for the online: the projections, images, words, and systems that live exclusively behind the black screens of
    <a href="smartphone.html">smartphones,</a>
     tablets, and computers. In the digital realm, reality is frozen, shattered, and reconstructed into an illusory mosaic. From a distance, this mosaic appears representational of the 
        <a href="earth.html">real world,</a> 
    but upon closer inspection it is revealed to be a product of human imagination. <br>
    The digital world is incredibly disorienting. Never before in human history has a population been so aware of the context of their own existence. We understand the exchange of commerce. We understand different forms of government. We understand how other people live. We are all gathered in one room, looking at each other. <br>
    I feel very lost in it all. I want the world to be the place I was taught it was when I was a little girl. This place is simpler and makes more sense. It is less noisy. It is safer. I see this place in some of my favorite 
    <a href="story.html">books</a> 
    and
    <a href="movies.html">movies,</a> 
    I hear it in my favorite 
    <a href="music.html">songs.</a>
    It is the world not seen through a 
    <a href="waysofseeing.html">lens,</a>  
    but pushed a filter. It is pure life, distilled down. <br>
    This project is a work in progress. It is my attempt to give the world, as I see it, a digital imprint. It is a space for me to share thoughts and free myself from linearity. I think online clicking is more fun than online scrolling. <br>
    I hope you explore and enjoy.
