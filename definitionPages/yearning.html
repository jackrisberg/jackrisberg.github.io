        Yearning (energy):
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        To have a crush is a type of yearning, though yearning is a more expansive form of longing. To yearn involves some sort of distance between oneself and the object they desire. I cannot yearn for an orange, because it is easy for me to acquire one. If I’m yearning, it is for something separated from me by either space or time. The mountains, the sea, a boyfriend, a baby, a beautiful home with a garden. I desire these things constantly, but occasionally, as I walk to the train platform or wait for my toast to pop, I am hit with a longing so intense it aches, I can feel my heart reaching. This is yearning. <br>
        Though desire may be the root of all suffering, the desire that compounds as yearning is not painful. I may not have what I yearn for, but the reaching I feel in my heart is anchored in something more solid than hope. When I really, truly yearn it is as if I know the thing I want will be mine, it is as if a future self is so overwhelmed with love that her feelings can’t help but overflow back into me as longing. I picture Michelangelo’s “The Creation of Adam.” I picture myself as Adam and my future self as God. We live in different worlds and we do not touch, but when I yearn it is as if I am reaching a finger out and she is reaching one back. I stretch and stretch, trying to close the space between us, and in this process, I move closer towards the life of my dreams. <br>
