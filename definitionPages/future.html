        Part of me thinks it is a blank space, upon which we project our anxieties and dreams. The other part of me wonders if the future already exists and I just have yet to live it. If I (the me of the present) sends a prayer to a younger version of myself, could that younger version feel it? I wonder if my aspirations are not only coming from within my current self, but are being received from a future self. Like in Michelangelo’s Creation of Adam, these selves are reaching towards each other—embodied self on the left as Adam, and future self on the right as God, the ideal.
