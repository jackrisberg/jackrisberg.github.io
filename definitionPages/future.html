        Part of me thinks it is a blank space, upon which we project our anxieties and 
        <a href="REM.html">dreams.</a> 
        The other part of me wonders if the future already exists
        and I just have yet to live it. <br>
        If I (the me of the 
        <a href="present.html">present</a>)
         sends a prayer to a younger version of myself, could that younger version feel it? <br>
        I wonder if my aspirations are not only coming from within my current self, 
        but are being received from a <br> future self. <br>
