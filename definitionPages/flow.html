        Flow (state):
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
    To be in the flow state is to be consumed by the present. It is a form of meditation.  Flow is active. When you lose track of time as you paint or cook or make music, you are in flow <br>
    Exercising is a great way to enter the flow state, as is studying a subject that interests you. Taking notice of which activities put you in this headspace is a great way to find your path. 
    I only like two influencers and one of them is Addison Rae and the other is Gabi Abrao who makes content under @sighswoon. Gabi often talks about how she strives for flow. She describes it as intention + sensitivity + surrender. <br>
    Unlike the conventional notion of strength, which involves resistance (i.e. fighting through pain), flow suggests that we are at our strongest when we yield to the elements we cannot alter. It suggests that our focus is most graceful, powerful, and smooth when we allow ourselves to occupy the spacious pocket of the present moment.** Imagine yourself as a river. Be here now, be there then, the water will make it to the ocean every time. <br>
