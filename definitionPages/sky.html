       Sky (terrain):

    <div class="definition">
        Whenever you would like to leave your current landscape and enter a new one, you can simply look upwards. The sky is vast and deep. Clouds provide a sense of scale, and sometimes a sense of fantasy, like when you are looking out a plane window. The shade of the sky changes slightly each day but I hardly take the time to notice it. Sometimes it is a really true blue and I can help but notice it. Today it is pale blue and a lot of thin clouds are diffusing the light. Ever day at dawn and dusk, the sky becomes a theatre for the daily dances of sunrise and sunset. At these times, you can expect a spectacular show of light and color. Then, after the sunset, the sky gradually takes an entirely new form, known as the night sky.
