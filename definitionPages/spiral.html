    <div class="definition">

    DNA are the smallest spirals and galaxies are the biggest. “In mathematics, a spiral is a curve which emanates from a point, moving farther away as it revolves around the point. It is a subtype of whorled patterns, a broad group that also includes concentric objects.” The
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral" target="_blank"> Wikipedia</a> 
   page is very interesting because it teaches you about different types of 2D and 3D spirals, as well as the history of the form. <br>
