        REM (mystery):
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        When you go to sleep your brain’s electromagnetic wavelengths slow from beta to alpha, then down to theta, then down to delta, before shooting back up to beta speed wavelengths as the brain enters REM. So the brain is moving slower and slower and slower and then, in the deepest stage of sleep, the brain is as active as it is during the day, and nobody really knows why. They say that REM is the brain processing the events from the day, and this might be true, but when you smoke weed or drink alcohol, you don’t enter REM, and I know a lot of people who smoke every night and they seem perfectly fine. REM is not essential to what we perceive as proper functioning. <br>
        As I’ve grown increasingly interested in understanding consciousness, I’ve stopped smoking weed entirely. I’m dreaming a lot more now. My dreams are strange and often scary. During the day, I feel more anxious than I did when I was smoking at night. But maybe I’m just purging.
