    The present is all that actually exists. <br>
    It is an airpocket in the flat line of 
    <a href="time.html">time.</a>
    If you try to sit anywhere else, you won't be able to breath. <br>
    Through embracing the present, a day otherwise wasted inside of oneâ€™s own head, lost in the fantasies of the 
    <a href="past.html">past</a>
    and 
    <a href="future.html">future,</a> 
    becomes a day lived fully. <br>
    To notice a moment is to love it. To give thanks for it is to bless it. <br>
