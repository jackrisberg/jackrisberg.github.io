        My former professor and first spiritual 
        <a href="ramdass.html">teacher,</a>
        Kirk, is working a book on about the spirit and importance of play. I have yet to full flesh out what play means to me, but I have more respect for it now than I did through my teen years. I try to carry the buoyancy and sincerity of play with me into everything that I do. <br>

       <a href="money.html">penny,</a>
        which is the coin I flip when I need guidance.
