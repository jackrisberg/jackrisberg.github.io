        Menstrual Cycle (pattern):
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        Women have been trained to minimize the significance of our menstrual cycles. <br>
        Because it dictates my hormones, my menstrual cycle underscores my entire life. My mood, my energy levels, my ability to 
        <a href="stretching.html">exercise,</a>
        my diet, are all tied to which phase my cycle I am in, and taking the time to track these phases has changed my life. My moods are rarely random, I understand why I’m feeling tired and weak, or energized and strong. <br>
        My 
        <a href="time.html">cycle</a>
        is, on average, 44 days. This is much longer than the lunar 28 and I blame my city girl lifestyle for this difference. The menstrual cycle is divided into two main phases, the follicular phase and the luteal phase. The follicular phase prepares the body for ovulation by shedding the dead uterine lining. During this time estrogen levels increase until luteinizing hormones spike, triggering ovulation and the luteal phase. In the luteal phase, progesterone levels increase, and estrogen levels increase as well, but less so than pre-ovulation. Right before menstruation, all hormone levels dip down. <br>
        This is what happens to the hormones now let me tell you how it feels. The best phase is post-period, pre-ovulation. This is when I feel energized, clear headed, and strong. I have a big appetite and I crave sex, especially as I near ovulation. This period lasts about two weeks. Then I bleed a little when I ovulate, some women do. Then post-ovulation I very slowly start to feel increasingly tired and anxious. I eat less, I’m not as strong. After two weeks of gradual decline, I’m eager for my period to come so I can begin a new cycle. The three days before it starts my breasts will start to ache and my hips will feel sore. I get into the typical PMS mood swings where almost anything will make me cry. And then, it starts, putting me back into the follicular phase, immediately improving my energy and mood. I often have to deal with some cramping on the second day, but my periods are fairly mild, and more than anything, I celebrate the process of
