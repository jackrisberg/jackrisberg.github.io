        Sex (necessity):
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        Our need for sex is as basic as our need for food, water, air. Sex may not be as necessary as those things, but our want for it is uncomplicated. It is understood from a place before words. I’ve had a fair amount of sex, but never consistently with someone I love and trust. Thus, most of the sexual encounters I’ve had would be considered “hook ups.” I imagine my hook ups are a simulacra of real sex—two people going through the motions of intercourse without having any real desire to connect or communicate. Body without soul, head without heart. I’m getting tired of it. I never come. I want the kind of sex that involves rolling around and biting each others cheeks and not getting out of bed all day because there is nowhere else either of you would rather be. I’ve recently revised the list of things I’m looking for in a boyfriend and #1 is this must be someone I really, really want to have sex with. If I secretly think that he’s a little ugly or smelly or small, that’s not going to work because then I’ll probably get a little repulsed during sex. The part of my brain that thinks we’re making a baby will be like, “really? with this guy?” If I secretly think he’s too polished and shiny and perforative, that’s also not going to work because I’ll probably feel watched and judged. I don’t want to be watched during sex, I just want to be felt.
