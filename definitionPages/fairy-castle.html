        Colleen Moore's Fairy Castle:
    </div>
    <div class="definition">
        One of my favorite creations is Colleen Mooreâ€™s Fairy Castle. <br>
        She was a silent film starlet, one of the first to wear her hair bobbed. In 1928 her father built her this elaborate dollhouse, with the help of a team of Hollywood set designers. It is 9 square feet with a 12 foot high tower. It has been on display at The Museum of Science and Industry since 1949.<br>
