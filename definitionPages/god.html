    <div class="definition">
        For the first two years of coming to my spirtuality, I referred to God as “The Universe,” which was acceptable because it is what made sense to me at the time. I understood God, which I called The Universe, as the force that pushes life forward. The example I used to explain this belief was how if a suicidal person tried to down themselves, at a certain point their body would try to swim—the pulse of life, The Universe, God, would fight to keep them alive. I’ve since realized that such a dramatic example is not necessary. A flower growing is God. I’ve also since realized that referring to God as The Universe is verbose and a little disrespectful. Life on earth is an incredible, flawless miracle. (Ignoring for a second humans, our affairs, and how horrible we are to each other, which is, in my opinion, not the work of God.) Everything in the world is in perfect balance. Yes there is death, and pain, but this is all apart of a grand cycle, that ultimately pushes the world into a better, more intricate and synchronized place. Calling God this proper name shows reverence for this balance. Mankind has never created anything as perfect as a single leaf, and so I say God.
