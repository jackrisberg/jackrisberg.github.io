      Earth (home):  
    </div>

    <div class="definition">
    Earth is home to all life on earth. It is the best planet in the solar system by far. The most amazing about earth is its diversity of 
    <a href="sky.html">landscapes</a>
    and 
    <a href="leaf.html">lifeforms,</a>
    and the 
    <a href="harmony.html">harmony</a>
    found between these things. Plants, germs, fungi,
    and animals all live side by side, none dominating over another, each filling a unique and perfect role. Though in recent years, this balance has been thrown. <br>
    Mankind has dominated Earth like an infection, and in our 
    <a href="money.html">greed,</a> 
    we have brought about extinction and 
    <a href="death.html">death.</a> 
    I am shameful of the way my own life perpetuates this destruction. I do not wish for mankind to suffer and perish, but I understand why Ted Kaczynski felt the way he did.
