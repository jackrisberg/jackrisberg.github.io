<span> Earth is home to all life on earth. It is the best planet in the solar system by far. The most amazing about earth is its diversity of landscapes and lifeforms, and the harmony found between these things. Plants, germs, fungi, and animals all live side by side, none dominating over another, each filling a unique and perfect role. Though in recent years, this balance has been thrown. Mankind has dominated Earth like an infection, and in our greed, we have brought about extinction and death. I am shameful of the way my own life perpetuates this destruction. I do not wish for mankind to suffer and perish, but I understand why Ted Kaczynski felt the way he did.
