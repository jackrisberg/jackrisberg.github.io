    <div class="definition">
        I love green tea. 
        I drink it every morning because its caffeine level is perfect for me. I feel awake and focused.
        I read on Reddit that a women’s doctor told her she couldn’t drink green tea during chemotherapy because its cellular protective properties are so significant. <br>
        It contains many antioxidants, which help calm inflammation. It is said to benefit the skin and defend against tons of terrible diagnoses. I wonder how much of that stuff is from the tea, and how much is just from drinking a cup of hot water slowly, thoughtfully.
