    Storytelling is a uniquely human art form. 
    Birds 
    can sing songs and monkeys can paint pictures, but only a human can tell a story. The realm of the story exists outside of time. Whereas we walk from 
    present to present, with the past behind us and the future ahead, a story can jump from 
    <a href="past.html">past</a>
    to 
    <a href="future.html">future</a>
    to 
    <a href="present.html">present</a>
    and back to past all within a few sentences. <br>
