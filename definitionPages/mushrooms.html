        The first time I took mushrooms it was during covid with my best friend Leah. We walked to a greenbelt near her parents house and spent a long time looking at the 
        <a href="flower.html">flowers</a>
        and grass. We communed with a bunny. We felt tied together on an unseen plane. I took this photo because I thought the leaves were making crazy patterns, and revisiting the photo later, I see that they really were. <br>
        I’ve taken mushrooms quite a few times since then and my experience is always overwhelmingly positive. I learn so much about myself and the world around me. I feel hypersensitive to the magnificent beauty of the world, and overwhelmed with gratitude. <br>
        I believe that the drug will meet you wherever you’re ready to be met, and carry you a few steps further along your path. It is something I recommend everyone try, in a safe environment, with the support they may need.<br>

        HOW TO HAVE A GREAT TRIP<br>
        1.	<b>set some loose intentions.</b> Is there a question you want answered? Is there an area within yourself that you want to explore? Is there an object or process you want to feel with heightened sensitivity? <br>
        2.	<b>be in a safe space.</b> If you are new to mushrooms, you should plan to trip in an environment that is very familiar and safe. You want to have easy access to food, water, a bathroom, a comfy chair or bed, and ideally, the outdoors. Mushrooms make you incredibly sensitive, so being somewhere where you can get as comfortable as possible is, in my opinion, most enjoyable. <br>
        2.5. <b>wear comfy clothes.</b> When I take mushrooms I feel like a wildebeest. I want my hair down and my clothes to be flowy and loose. <br>
        3.	<b>have someone you can call.</b> If you’re someone who gets anxious, you might need a trip sitter. If you’re not, maybe just make sure you have a friend you can call if you get freaked. I’ve never gotten freaked, I always think I might and then the second the mushrooms hit, I am filled with an overwhelming sense of peace. However, even if this is the case, you may still want to call a friend, just to hear their voice and to tell them you love them. <br>
        4.	<b>go outside.</b> You will be amazed by how gorgeous the world is. You will be amazed that the wind
        that moves through the 
        <a href="trees.html">treetops</a>
        is the same that you breathe into your lungs. You will see 
        <a href="symmetry.html">patterns</a>
        and rainbows. <br>
        5.	<b>eat a fruit.</b> If you eat a fruit on mushrooms it will be like biting into a rare and precious gem. <br>
        6.	<b>listen to music.</b> If you listen to 
        <a href="music.html">music</a>
        on mushrooms it will tune your soul to its frequency and you will ride its waves. <br>
