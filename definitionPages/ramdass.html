    <div class="definition">
        Ram Dass is a spiritual teacher. Very popular guy. I recommend reading his 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Dass" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
        page if you are unfamiliar. Before learning of Ram Dass, all the spiritual knowledge I  engaged with was very derivative. It was coming in the form of

        This has taught me that growth will happen as I am ready for it. I do not need to be anxious, as the shedding of old skin is inevitable. <br>
        2. Words are like fingers pointing at the moon. <br>
        The more I write, the more I am captured by the space before words, by all that the world contains which cannot be articulated into a box. I’m currently in love for the first time and my friends want to know what I’ve been writing about it. The answer is nothing, I’m just staring at the

        for now. <br>
